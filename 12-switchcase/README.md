[SwitchCase](https://go.dev/tour/flowcontrol/9)

This is `SwitchCase` go code and I am using Visual Studio WSL[Ubuntu] for performing practical. I have installed `go` Extension in visual studio.

1. this command will generate a `go.mod` file.

```
go mod init switchcase
```

while writing code if VS Code is showing install tools related to go then click on install.

2. Run `main.go` file by using.

```
go run main.go
```

## Output
The output of the above program is - 

```
>> go run main.go  

Switch and Case in go
